# What Do We Have
What Do We Have is an Android application developed using Kotlin that handles household type of inventory. The idea is to keep track of food or items in your household that has an expiration date. The goal of this app is to help you keep track which item is about to expire for you to be able to plan ahead wisely.

This app also functions as an inventory management app that helps you track the remaining quantity of each item so you won't have to go back to the store just because you forgot that you've already ran out of a certain food or item.

# Future Plans
A feature currently under development is the ability to set notification based on how frequent you want to be notified if a certain item is about to expire in a week or a month.

Another feature planned for this application is integration with Google Firebase to implement list sharing between app users living in the same house.
